Welcome to autoregressive-bbh-inference's documentation!
========================================================

This page details the code used to produce the results presented in *A parameter-free tour of the binary black hole population*, which can be accessed at

https://github.com/tcallister/autoregressive-bbh-inference/

In this paper, we modeled the distributions of binary black hole masses, spins, and redshifts using flexible *autoregressive processes*,
seeking to robustly identify the set of physical features appearing in these distributions without the need for strongly-parametrized population models.
Using the GWTC-3 catalog of LIGO/Virgo compact binary detections, we see the following:
